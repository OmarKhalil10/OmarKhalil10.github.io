# Weather journal app project

### That is my second project for the Front End Web Development Professional Nanodegree Program, and I hope to successfully use what I've learned in this course to satisfy all the project requirements.

1. I made the **Server** using **JavaScript**.

2. I installed **Node** and **Express** on the local machine.

3. I installed The **cors package** in the project from the **command line**.

4. I imported a **Weather Api** to create data for each **region**.

5. I **installed** and **included** The **body-parser package** in the project. 

6. I have also Created **API** credentials on **OpenWeatherMap.com**.

7. I created an **Object** named **projectData** in the **server.js** file to act as the app API **endpoint**.

8. I used **fetch()** method and **passed** The **API Key** variable as a parameter to it.

9. I used **GET** Route & **POST** Route **methods** to **return** the JS object created at the **top** of **server** code.

10. I used **innerHTML()** method and it's **dynamically** set to the **DOM elements** according to **data** returned by the **app route**.

11. I made a flexible (Collapsible) **Navigation Bar** with **toggler icon** as I was **asked** in **the previous project review**.

12. I have also **added** some **Icons** with my **social media** accounts on it. 

13. I made a **button** to **sumbit** the **zip code** and **feelings** value then **get** the weather data.

14. I manipulated the css **properties** for each element in the **body** of the page.

15. I added a background **music** to the **page** and I used some **Bootstrap Icons** to add some fun to the page.

16. I made a **button** to **pause** and **resume** the **background music** by using**JavaScript** and I also added a nice **css** with a **smooth** transition to it.
